#MLParser
Price parser for MercadoLivre/MercadoLibre ads
This script is very simple and (at this moment) is able to return the following metrics:
- Average;
- Mode;
- Median;
- Standard Deviation;
- Median Grouped;
- Minimum;
- Maximum.

This scrip must be called with the MercadoLivre/Mercadolibre query URL as an argument as follows:
- python MLParser.py http://celulares.mercadolivre.com.br/iphone/iphone-5s/cinza-espacial/32gb/_ItemTypeID_U

The URL will contain the desired query made on the MercadoLivre/MercadoLibre search engine and the desire categorization and filtering. This is good because you can search for better customized results and make better statistics.

#ToDo List:
- Make dynamic the zScore;
- Implement some intelligence to wait for an interval between the queries (to avoid blocking);
- Other improvements yet not pictured.


This script was born because my sister wanted to sell her used iPhone and asked me how much should she ask for it! :)
